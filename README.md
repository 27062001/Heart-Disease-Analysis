Project Title: Unveiling Heart Disease Risk Factors: A Data-Driven Exploration with Tableau

Project Overview:
This project delves into a heart disease diagnostic dataset to identify key risk factors associated with the condition. Utilizing Tableau, an interactive dashboard was created to visualize trends and relationships between various attributes, aiding in a comprehensive understanding of heart disease prevalence and potential risk factors.

Dashboard Purpose and Insights:
The interactive dashboard aims to provide healthcare professionals with a clear and informative overview of heart disease risk factors and their distribution across different demographics. Key insights revealed by the analysis include:

Correlations between attributes: Significant correlations were found between factors like cholesterol levels, age, and heart disease prevalence.
Risk factor visualization: The dashboard allows users to explore these relationships visually, enabling them to gain insights into potential risk factors for different patient groups.
